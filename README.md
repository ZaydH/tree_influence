TreeInfluence: Influence Estimation for Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees
---
**tree_influence** is a python library that implements influence estimation for gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs), adapting popular techniques such as TracIn and Influence Functions to GBDTs. This library is compatible with all major GBDT frameworks including LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and SKLearn.
