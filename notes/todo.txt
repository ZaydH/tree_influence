Influence Estimation
---
- Consider adding batch size for TracInCP to make it more consistent with the original paper.
- Should the name SubSample be changed? Why is the second "s" capitalized?
	* Would require changing ALL plots.

- Put TreeSim absolute runtimes next to efficiency plot or in the appendix. DONE.
- Made significance of gray box clearer in Figure 5. DONE.
- Restructured LeafRefit, LeafInfluence, and LeafInfSP. DONE.
- Added summary of all the methods at the end of Section 3. DONE.
- Move WeightedLeafPath tree kernel footnote to experiments. DONE.
- Added bigger parantheses for the TREX equation. DONE.
- Edited description of changing training label methodology. DONE.
- Revised tree kernel discussion in TREX section. DONE.
- Changed \psi to \tilde{\theta} in most places, and added to notation section. DONE.
- Consider expanding the explanation for Feldman and Zhang before introducing Subsample. DONE.
- Add RF predictive performance results. DONE.
- Line up numbers in Tables 2 and 3. DONE.
	* 2-level sort: metric, then alphabetical. DONE.
- State we use the indicator function. DONE.
- State hyper-parameters for SubSample are recommended by Feldman and Zhang. DONE.
- Add Daniel and Zayd influence paper reference into the paper. DONE.
- Fix typo in the abstract. DONE.
- Fix capitalization errors in references. DONE.
- Run paper through grammarly. DONE.
- Add mention of comparison to LeafInfluence (abstract). DONE.
- Maybe provide some detail about the empirical measures and how rankings
	may change depending on the measure (introduction). DONE.
- Make sure sheer number of methods compared comes through (introduction). DONE.
- Remove Z* from early introduction. DONE.
- De-emphasize qualitative analysis from DL papers in introduction. DONE.
- Un-hyphenate "deep-learning". DONE.
- Change order of empirical findings; our main finding is NOT that
	LeafInfluence is a poor approximation of LOO (introduction). DONE.
- DShap is not "more principled", it gives an average LOO given more context (Sec. 2.1). DONE.
	* Could do "Another approach..."; or something more subtle. DONE.
- Check capitalization of "Representer-Point" and "Influence Functions". DONE.
- Merge last par. of sec. 3.1 to prev. par. DONE.
- Mention LeafInfluence-SP before BoostIn, fully defining or providing a preview
	in the LeafInfluence section (Sec. 3.1). DONE.
- Combine last sentence of Sec. 3.2. to previous paragraph (Sec. 3.2). DONE.
- Make new paragraph in after equations in Sec. 3.2.1 and merge last paragraph
	to the previous one (Sec. 3.2.1). DONE.
- Two examples are TREATED identically, sec. 3.3. DONE.
- Fix "regresion" (Sec. 3.3, footnote 6). DONE.
- How to interpret Figure 5, make text clearer about the significance. DONE.
- Potentially summarize experiment descriptions before Figure 2; then supplementary
	analysis comes after. Still mention extra analysis for each sec. in appendix (experiments). DONE.
	* Keep backup. DONE.
	* Move runtime comparison to earlier in supplementary analysis. DONE.
